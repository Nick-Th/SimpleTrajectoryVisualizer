# SimpleTrajectoryVisualizer

This project was created as part of an Assignment at my University. It lets you calculate and visualize trajectories for 
a car-like-robot with rear drive. It has three different Modes:

1. constant       - The vehicle moves with a constant steering angle
2. linear         - The vehicles steering angle is calculated with a linear function
3. trigonometric  - The vehicles steering angle changes with a trigonometric function

For more information about this specific functions, check out the code.
For more information about the command-line options check the code or run the main with option -h.
